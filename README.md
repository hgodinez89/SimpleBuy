## What is this?

This is an E-commerce website integrated with Stripe platform, this integration allows online payment processing and storing with all security measures. It was created with Django, HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS), JavaScript & MySQL Database.</br>
Important if you want to try this website in your computer, you need to create your own **secret.py** file (I recommend you create it in the store folder, next to settings.py), it should has a format similar like this: </br> </br>
```
class Secrets:
    SECRET_KEY_DJANGO = 'your own Django's apiKey, it's generated when your start your project'
    STRIPE_PUB_KEY = 'your own public Stripe's apiKey'
    STRIPE_PRIV_KEY = 'your own private Stripe's apiKey'
    HOST_DB = 'your own host database'
    USER_DB = 'you database user'
    PASSWORD_DB = 'user's database password'
    NAME_DB = 'database name'
    MAILJET_PUB_KEY = 'your own public MailJet's apiKey to send notifications from GCP for customers orders, etc'
    MAILJET_PRIV_KEY = 'your own private MailJet's apiKey to send notifications from GCP for customers orders, etc'
```
